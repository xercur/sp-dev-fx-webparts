## Minimal Path to Awesome

* clone repo
* Using the Office365 CLI, connect to your tenant and run the following commands (this will add the proper permissions to the Tenant, in order to call Graph API):
  - spo serviceprincipal grant add --resource "Microsoft Graph" --scope "User.Read.All"
  - spo serviceprincipal grant add --resource "Microsoft Graph" --scope "Presence.Read.All"
* run _gulp serve_
* open the SharePoint workbench in a Modern Team site (Communication site does not have a Group)

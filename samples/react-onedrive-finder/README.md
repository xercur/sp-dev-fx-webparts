```bash
o365 spo login https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com
o365 spo serviceprincipal grant add --resource 'Microsoft Graph' --scope 'Files.Read'
o365 spo serviceprincipal grant add --resource 'Microsoft Graph' --scope 'Files.Read.All'
o365 spo serviceprincipal grant add --resource 'Microsoft Graph' --scope 'Sites.Read.All'
